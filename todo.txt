Better any tab:
- label messages with origin tab somehow (text labels, bg color, whatever (this should be configurable))
- ability to view while posting to a different tab

chatjs API:
- support for existing scripts? compatibility layer for browser chat?
- global vars, or keep everything inside API object?
- decide on function names, silly
- maybe better message event handlers (define which message type/etc. to call it on rather than needing if() inside the function)
-- like: API.onMessage({type:"system", subtype:"leave"}, function(msg){ ... idk

rp version 3:
- store data in json or something
- more fields
- maybe use /me instead of normal messages?

Input:
- completely rewrite textbox input system to support cursor movements etc.
- better shortcuts
- maybe support process suspend / restore (for some reason I can't get blessed to re-initialize properly on being resumed)

Connection:
- auto-detect websocket being blocked

- Better command line argument handling maybe

- it would be nice if chatjs scripts didn't have access to your chatauth/session but I don't think that's practical

- print important error messages as warningmessages in chat
